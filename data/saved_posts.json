The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forçade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis. The magazine has been involved in the marijuana-using counterculture since its inception.\n\nOn Jan 29th, 2020, ditched dreams of [NASDAQ Listing](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/high-times-ditches-dreams-of-nasdaq-listing/)\n\n\u0026gt;Hightimes Holding Corp., parent of High Times, revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the NASDAQ, a goal it had been pursuing for since mid-2017. The company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the Reg A+ process, and it reported that it would extend its Reg A+ capital raise until 4.545 million shares had been sold or until March 31st. It disclosed in an SEC filing that it recently sold 363,636 shares at $5.50 in a private placement to Ontario-based Rayray Investments (Raymond Leach, an original investor in MedReleaf), a 50% discount to where it has been selling shares.\n\nHigh Times securities lawyers, Stephen Weiss and Megan Penick of L.A. based Michelman Robinson LLP, confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors.\n\n[High Times IPO - Sorry, No Refunds - Teri Buhl of Cannabis Law Reports Talks Reg A](https://vimeo.com/438846483)\n\n**Harvest Acquisitions**\n\nIt was in March that Harvest Health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company. Then, literally two months later, we see a letter of intent filed by Hightimes now and Harvest saying, \n\n\u0026gt;\"Okay well, we\u0027re actually going to buy the California assets of Have a Heart.\" \n\nWhy that was contradictory is that Harvest had just been on an investor call telling people, when an analyst asked, \n\n\u0026gt;\"Why are you doing this deal?\" They said, \"Well, we want a stronger footprint in California.\" \n\nIt didn\u0027t make sense that two months later they\u0027re getting rid of everything they just bought in California.\n\nAdditionally, in the last month there have been[multiple news reports](https://mjbizdaily.com/high-times-cannabis-retail-bid-complicated-by-web-of-owners-social-equity-partners/amp/) questioning if Harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to High Times.\n\nVery little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by High Times; instead it has announced millions of stock *(which isn’t publicly traded yet)* will pay for the asset purchases. With the Harvest acquisition, High Times attorney Stephen Weiss confirmed for CLR that $1.5 million was paid to Harvest but at signing only $500k was given. The asset purchase agreement filed with the SEC said High Times would pay Harvest $1 million on signing.\n\nThis is just a complete lack of transparency, and it\u0027s completely unfair for the Main Street investor trying to get into cannabis.\n\n**Done before starting**\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has told a U.S. operated cannabis media and dispensary company, High Times Holdings, that they must halt accepting investments in their mini-IPO because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report.\n\n\u0026gt;The last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of June.\n\nHigh Times used a reporting extension the SEC created because of the Covid-19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent SEC disclosure filings, called Form 1-U, that they promised investors to get them current revenue, cash flows, debt levels and asset values by June 12, 2020 via the annual report; but CLR has learnt that this never happened.\n\nAdam Levin’s company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $US50 million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the OTC Markets under the ticker $HITM.\n\nOn June 30th, 2020 the company made an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000149315220012247/0001493152-20-012247-index.htm) announcing once again their mini-ipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldn’t actually accept sales.\n\nWhen asked if it is normal practice for a Reg A issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can’t accept sales; securities attorney Sara Hanks said:\n\n*”The SEC may have softened up in the Covid crisis but previously, both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings, because there is no exemption under Reg A  for “offers” (advertising etc) while a company is delinquent.”*\n\nHigh Times still has their investment offering page [live](https://hightimesinvestor.com/?utm_source\u003dgoogle\u0026amp;utm_medium\u003dsearch\u0026amp;utm_campaign\u003dhightimesx\u0026amp;gclid\u003dCj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLylKUJKyHSWhczvAcJAdLVBjLED6hTfWbWCb4Oejeqm5j-yCs4zpgaAgzCEALw_wcB)\n\nSince then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases, via signed letter of intents, hyping the potential growth of High Times followed up with quiet SEC filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down. \n\nI have personally fallen for this sham (F), as I invested in 5000 units in 2018. They stopped responding to my inquires, in fact, there was a random charge on my credit card (from an airport in LA) the same day they charged my card for the IPO.. they stated that it would be refunded - never was. I can still log on and see the shares I have “invested” but they obviosuly don’t represent anything. Lesson learned..\n\n**Recent Financials**\n\nThe company filed a[post-qualification amendment to its Form 1-A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000121390018007523/f1apos2018a1_hightimeshold.htm) with the SEC that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious. In the first quarter of 2018, sales plunged 64.9% to just $1.481 million:\n\nMost of the decline can be attributed to the events business, which fell almost 83%, but publishing revenue declined over 16% as well. The company indicated that its Cannabis Cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year, with one in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018. The $554K in sales were generated by smaller events, and the company expects the number of Cannabis Cups and small events to increase for the full year. It blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue, with digital partially offsetting these factors.\n\nThe company provided information about its cost of revenue, which was $503K, as well as its operating expenses, which declined substantially to $2.391 million, producing an operating loss of $1.413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $6.54 million. Much of the year-ago operating expenses were due to a one-time non-cash charge of $6.689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting.\n\nThe last time the company filed official annual earnings was June 2019. High Times had told investors it would get updated financial information on June 12, but that did not happen. The company has extended the offering of shares for two years, initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the NASDAQ. Then it lowered those expectations to the Over-The-Counter Marketplace. \n\n**Still, it hasn’t happened.**\n\n*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own

1/2.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n**Seeing some small put options flow on this ticker, so be cautious and be aware of your own risk management.**\n\n[Daily

Maybe usa last. Shorted to hell. Shares cheap as fuck rn. Primed for lift off. May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math\n\n\nIm here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. \nLets start with the bad. \n\nIn 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. \n\nIt has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. \nWhen the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.\n\nMany big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. \n\nHonestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. \nThe good.\nIts absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times \"he loves burning shorts\".\nLast week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. \nThe market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. \nIts efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. \nToday the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.\nThey have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.\nInstitutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short.

But let’s look at what has actually happened. \n\n**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**\n\nSure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it’s still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.\n\nThe facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion’s share of total refunds.\n\nCurrently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30€ then its #7, #5 for +40€, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it’s still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that’s it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.\n\nSo let’s run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no €250 collectors editions. Let’s also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let’s say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us €690m in revenue and that’s more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that’s just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.\n\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-24-cyberpunk-2077-is-now-the-biggest-digital-game-launch-of-all-time\n\nhttps://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/\n\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**The hack**\n\nSource code was stolen but that’s not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that’s 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won’t be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.\n\nLost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**The hidden gem**\n\nNow let’s look at what’s actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I’m sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self’s they are alright but together they could be explosive.\n\nThe Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won’t be affected by it. \n\nThe Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647\n\nI believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won’t make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. \n\nOne could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn’t popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**M\u0026amp;A**\n\nA third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M\u0026amp;A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**So whats the price target?** \n\nWell the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL DR**\n\nBased on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.\n\nThe Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.\n\nLost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.\n\nThe combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.\n\nAn increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.\n\nPrice target of 300-350, now trading at 230","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9436146,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Fellow Apes, Retards and other Degenerates may I have your attention please!
