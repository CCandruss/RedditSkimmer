The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forçade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis. The magazine has been involved in the marijuana-using counterculture since its inception.\n\nOn Jan 29th, 2020, ditched dreams of [NASDAQ Listing](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/high-times-ditches-dreams-of-nasdaq-listing/)\n\n\u0026gt;Hightimes Holding Corp., parent of High Times, revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the NASDAQ, a goal it had been pursuing for since mid-2017. The company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the Reg A+ process, and it reported that it would extend its Reg A+ capital raise until 4.545 million shares had been sold or until March 31st. It disclosed in an SEC filing that it recently sold 363,636 shares at $5.50 in a private placement to Ontario-based Rayray Investments (Raymond Leach, an original investor in MedReleaf), a 50% discount to where it has been selling shares.\n\nHigh Times securities lawyers, Stephen Weiss and Megan Penick of L.A. based Michelman Robinson LLP, confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors.\n\n[High Times IPO - Sorry, No Refunds - Teri Buhl of Cannabis Law Reports Talks Reg A](https://vimeo.com/438846483)\n\n**Harvest Acquisitions**\n\nIt was in March that Harvest Health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company. Then, literally two months later, we see a letter of intent filed by Hightimes now and Harvest saying, \n\n\u0026gt;\"Okay well, we\u0027re actually going to buy the California assets of Have a Heart.\" \n\nWhy that was contradictory is that Harvest had just been on an investor call telling people, when an analyst asked, \n\n\u0026gt;\"Why are you doing this deal?\" They said, \"Well, we want a stronger footprint in California.\" \n\nIt didn\u0027t make sense that two months later they\u0027re getting rid of everything they just bought in California.\n\nAdditionally, in the last month there have been[multiple news reports](https://mjbizdaily.com/high-times-cannabis-retail-bid-complicated-by-web-of-owners-social-equity-partners/amp/) questioning if Harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to High Times.\n\nVery little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by High Times; instead it has announced millions of stock *(which isn’t publicly traded yet)* will pay for the asset purchases. With the Harvest acquisition, High Times attorney Stephen Weiss confirmed for CLR that $1.5 million was paid to Harvest but at signing only $500k was given. The asset purchase agreement filed with the SEC said High Times would pay Harvest $1 million on signing.\n\nThis is just a complete lack of transparency, and it\u0027s completely unfair for the Main Street investor trying to get into cannabis.\n\n**Done before starting**\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has told a U.S. operated cannabis media and dispensary company, High Times Holdings, that they must halt accepting investments in their mini-IPO because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report.\n\n\u0026gt;The last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of June.\n\nHigh Times used a reporting extension the SEC created because of the Covid-19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent SEC disclosure filings, called Form 1-U, that they promised investors to get them current revenue, cash flows, debt levels and asset values by June 12, 2020 via the annual report; but CLR has learnt that this never happened.\n\nAdam Levin’s company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $US50 million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the OTC Markets under the ticker $HITM.\n\nOn June 30th, 2020 the company made an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000149315220012247/0001493152-20-012247-index.htm) announcing once again their mini-ipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldn’t actually accept sales.\n\nWhen asked if it is normal practice for a Reg A issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can’t accept sales; securities attorney Sara Hanks said:\n\n*”The SEC may have softened up in the Covid crisis but previously, both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings, because there is no exemption under Reg A  for “offers” (advertising etc) while a company is delinquent.”*\n\nHigh Times still has their investment offering page [live](https://hightimesinvestor.com/?utm_source\u003dgoogle\u0026amp;utm_medium\u003dsearch\u0026amp;utm_campaign\u003dhightimesx\u0026amp;gclid\u003dCj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLylKUJKyHSWhczvAcJAdLVBjLED6hTfWbWCb4Oejeqm5j-yCs4zpgaAgzCEALw_wcB)\n\nSince then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases, via signed letter of intents, hyping the potential growth of High Times followed up with quiet SEC filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down. \n\nI have personally fallen for this sham (F), as I invested in 5000 units in 2018. They stopped responding to my inquires, in fact, there was a random charge on my credit card (from an airport in LA) the same day they charged my card for the IPO.. they stated that it would be refunded - never was. I can still log on and see the shares I have “invested” but they obviosuly don’t represent anything. Lesson learned..\n\n**Recent Financials**\n\nThe company filed a[post-qualification amendment to its Form 1-A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000121390018007523/f1apos2018a1_hightimeshold.htm) with the SEC that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious. In the first quarter of 2018, sales plunged 64.9% to just $1.481 million:\n\nMost of the decline can be attributed to the events business, which fell almost 83%, but publishing revenue declined over 16% as well. The company indicated that its Cannabis Cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year, with one in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018. The $554K in sales were generated by smaller events, and the company expects the number of Cannabis Cups and small events to increase for the full year. It blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue, with digital partially offsetting these factors.\n\nThe company provided information about its cost of revenue, which was $503K, as well as its operating expenses, which declined substantially to $2.391 million, producing an operating loss of $1.413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $6.54 million. Much of the year-ago operating expenses were due to a one-time non-cash charge of $6.689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting.\n\nThe last time the company filed official annual earnings was June 2019. High Times had told investors it would get updated financial information on June 12, but that did not happen. The company has extended the offering of shares for two years, initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the NASDAQ. Then it lowered those expectations to the Over-The-Counter Marketplace. \n\n**Still, it hasn’t happened.**\n\n*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own

are green tomorrow, 1/2 size position would be acceptable.\n\nWe must break the short term resistance of this uptrend @ 87.00; only then will I feel confident to buy other 1/2.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n**Seeing some small put options flow on this ticker, so be cautious and be aware of your own risk management.**\n\n[Daily

Maybe usa last. Shorted to hell. Shares cheap as fuck rn. Primed for lift off. May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math\n\n\nIm here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. \nLets start with the bad. \n\nIn 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. \n\nIt has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. \nWhen the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.\n\nMany big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. \n\nHonestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. \nThe good.\nIts absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times \"he loves burning shorts\".\nLast week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. \nThe market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. \nIts efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. \nToday the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.\nThey have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.\nInstitutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short.

But let’s look at what has actually happened. \n\n**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**\n\nSure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it’s still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.\n\nThe facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion’s share of total refunds.\n\nCurrently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30€ then its #7, #5 for +40€, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it’s still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that’s it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.\n\nSo let’s run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no €250 collectors editions. Let’s also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let’s say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us €690m in revenue and that’s more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that’s just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.\n\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-24-cyberpunk-2077-is-now-the-biggest-digital-game-launch-of-all-time\n\nhttps://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/\n\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**The hack**\n\nSource code was stolen but that’s not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that’s 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won’t be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.\n\nLost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**The hidden gem**\n\nNow let’s look at what’s actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I’m sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self’s they are alright but together they could be explosive.\n\nThe Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won’t be affected by it. \n\nThe Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647\n\nI believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won’t make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. \n\nOne could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn’t popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**M\u0026amp;A**\n\nA third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M\u0026amp;A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**So whats the price target?** \n\nWell the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.\n\n \u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL DR**\n\nBased on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.\n\nThe Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.\n\nLost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.\n\nThe combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.\n\nAn increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.\n\nPrice target of 300-350, now trading at 230","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9436146,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Fellow Apes, Retards and other Degenerates may I have your attention please!

If you\u0027re interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! \n\nSonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both \u0027stay home\u0027 and \u0027reopen\u0027 trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. \n\nTL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. \n\n**What is a Sonos?**\n\n*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* \n\nBasically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they\u0027ve said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). \n\n**Reasons for buying them long term:**\n\nI could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos\u0027 systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I\u0027m only going to focus on TOMORROW. \n\n**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** \n\nNew product announced.  Go look at Sonos\u0027 stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they\u0027re going to announce.  It\u0027s already been leaked.  It\u0027s the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. \n\n[Here\u0027s a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)\n\nBut here\u0027s why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn\u0027t picked up on this because it hasn\u0027t hit any of the media they cover.  It\u0027s going to be new information to them.  While you\u0027ll have the leg up on it. \n\nThe Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  \n\nTo give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that\u0027s worth 12% upside from it\u0027s closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. \n\n**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** \n\nLet\u0027s imagine you\u0027re having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don\u0027t.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  \n\nNow let\u0027s pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q\u0027s numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you\u0027re going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. \n\nSituation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they\u0027ll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they\u0027re confident. \n\n**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**\n\nI\u0027m cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it\u0027s likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos\u0027 management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. \n\n**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** \n\nI\u0027ll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos\u0027 catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don\u0027t want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They\u0027ve been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. \n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nSonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I\u0027m happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more. \n\nPositions: 1500 shares, 3/19 35s, 4/16 40s, 7/16 45s. \n\nTL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464454,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Why you should buy Sonos (SONO) tomorrow","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0rako/why_you_should_buy_sonos_sono_tomorrow/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"author":"Fevid-Hadrock","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_32w8ivke","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1615240639,"domain":"self.wallstreetbets","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r9ec/bring_tsla_back_up_to_800_movement/","gildings":{},"id":"m0r9ec","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#800080","link_flair_css_class":"question","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"96f6c79e-b853-11e5-a4cb-0ebdf030e05d","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"some_ads","permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r9ec/bring_tsla_back_up_to_800_movement/","pinned":false,"post_time":0,"pwls":7,"retrieved_on":1615240650,"score":1,"selftext":"idk how but can we bring TSLA up again cause your man lost a shit ton of money","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464431,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Bring TSLA back up to 800 movement","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r9ec/bring_tsla_back_up_to_800_movement/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"author":"1carboniq1","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_76rfk9hp","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1615240539,"domain":"self.wallstreetbets","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r7yc/any_contacts_at_amc/","gildings":{},"id":"m0r7yc","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#800080","link_flair_css_class":"question","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"96f6c79e-b853-11e5-a4cb-0ebdf030e05d","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"some_ads","permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r7yc/any_contacts_at_amc/","pinned":false,"post_time":0,"pwls":7,"retrieved_on":1615240549,"score":1,"selftext":"Howdee Apes!\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be cool if they showed Planet of the Apes at all AMC theaters for a while?

HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀.**\n\nHang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.\n\n**Case 1 : VOLUME**\n\nLook at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.\n\nSecondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width\u003d467\u0026amp;format\u003dpjpg\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)\n\n \n\n**Case 2 : MACD**\n\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald\u0027s vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width\u003d493\u0026amp;format\u003dpjpg\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003de200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**\n\nFrom last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can\u0027t even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width\u003d498\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThere are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn\u0027t even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or \"In The Money\". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don\u0027t have it in possession on exercise.\n\nThis also doesn\u0027t consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.\n\nThe technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL. Don\u0027t be scared with dips as long as the trend is your friend. **🚀🚀🚀🚀**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464368,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3Gt_wDtGn9BTmUjw0Qzf3lohVJXbqzmuIi5td-yaWQY.jpg","thumbnail_height":140,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Technicals Show GME is Going Much Higher.

biopsies every year. I also wonder how many people hate the idea of getting a biopsy so they don’t go to the doctor and then end up with an advanced form of skin cancer or melanoma which is too late to treat. This is where $DMTK’s current smart patch and other upcoming non-invasive products could make the biggest difference.\n\n**DMTK** has already raised an additional $140 million in December 2020 so you probably don’t have to worry about another stock offering for 6 months.\n\n**DMTK** already has strong pipeline of non-invasive genomic based testing products they’ll be able to push through their growing network for dermatology and oncology practitioners.\n\n**DMTK** already has received blessing from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network — this is the gold standard in the industry when it comes to patient care and clinical best practices.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n**DermTech** $DMTK is a molecular diagnostics company that develops and markets non-invasive diagnostic tests to diagnose skin cancer and other skin related conditions. The company offers Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA), a gene expression test that helps rule out melanoma and the need for a surgical biopsy. $DMTK also provides the Nevome test, an adjunctive reflex test for the PLA and adhesive skin sample collection kits, as well as gene expression assays for the Th1, Th2, IFN-gamma, and Th17 inflammatory pathways. $DMTK is also developing non-melanoma skin cancer diagnostic and non-melanoma skin cancer risk assessment products. The $DMTK Melanoma Test is a new kind of lab test that looks for signs of melanoma in your skin’s genomic material. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjfuo5rwnvl61.png?width\u003d1383\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003da3e5566ec6d8fd2d14cb2559a7ec8b528abd1700\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqvk92rxnvl61.png?width\u003d271\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d83203772a04cd68d43e5625b01fd6f4ca2116690\n\n With the traditional biopsy care pathway, clinicians use their eyes — aided by a microscope — to see physical changes to a mole (aka pigmented lesion), and the cells within it. If the dermatologist is concerned with the mole they will order a biopsy, performed with a scalpel. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qpgqx7kynvl61.png?width\u003d1456\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d06834d4767743b504d6ee83341e17a133681a2f8\n\nThe $DMTK test uses a gene expression test to analyze the RNA inside those cells.\n\nSince the $DMTK testing method can find indications of melanoma at this more precise level, the disease can be detected far earlier and more accurately than the current biopsy pathway. This is all done from cells lifted off your mole with a simple pain-free adhesive sticker, not a scalpel. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7rijkpznvl61.png?width\u003d606\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003da531d35497a7f728d2fc1dc659390282018877e7\n\n Cancer starts when genes mutate within a cell. This altered cell duplicates and duplicates until enough cells exist to be seen under a microscope (and then, eventually, even without one). $DMTK’s genomic analysis can find these altered cancerous cells long before they show up under a microscope, through a proprietary gene expression test. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcyf1g01ovl61.png?width\u003d1456\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003db67577b45a23c35a7fc2ccd7b36e5e60b9854587\n\n \n\nThe expression test to search for PRAME and LINC00518 is done through an amplification process called RT-PCR (a polymerase chain reaction) that makes billions of copies of these genes so our scientists can study them in detail. When this analysis shows excessive levels of the PRAME and/or LINC00518 gene, it correlates with the presence of melanoma.\n\n$DMTK’s genomic testing smart patches have been such a breakthrough they also have agreements with companies like Biogen, L\u0027Oreal, and Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson to evaluate this technology in clinical trials for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne and other skin conditions.\n\n**COLLECTION PROCESS:**\n\nIf your doctor has identified a suspicious skin spot — one they would normally take a photograph of and track — now they can use the $DMTK test to rule out melanoma with 99% accuracy and better than the 83% accuracy of the current biopsy care pathways.\n\nOnce they have identified the spot, they’ll open the “Adhesive Skin Collection Kit” to begin the test. They’ll use the smart sticker to lift skin tissue off the spot by pressing, rubbing, and lifting the sticker. They’ll do this four times, placing each sticker on the collection strip.\n\nThe collections strips are then sent to the $DMTK lab in La Jolla, California where a team of experts and Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) oversee a fully automated testing process.

Since approximately half of all $DMTK patients are over the age of 60, the pandemic has had a clear impact on the older population being able to see their medical professionals in a timely manner. \n\n $DMTK is doing more digital marketing with an emphasis on “find a specialist” to help drive traffic to the dermatology offices in their network \\[[click here](https://dermtech.com/find-a-specialist/)\\].\n\nAs of mid-2020, $DMTK’s smart patch test is now eligible for full reimbursed by Medicare at $760 per patch with private payor coverage on the horizon. At some point in the future $DMTK’s smart patch will be the new standard of care rather than just a better alternative.\n\n \n\n**FINANCIALS:**\n\nThe current financials and revenue forecasts for $DMTK are nothing to get too excited about because we’re still dealing with small numbers compared to more established companies in the healthcare industry.\n\nHowever I believe $DMTK could grow revenues at 100% per year for the next 3-5 years (maybe longer). I have spoken to several dermatologists over the past couple weeks and they all said that $DMTK’s new smart patch is an absolute game changer for them and their patients.\n\nBased on $DMTK’s December 2020 estimate of 2,900 billable samples processed the 2021 revenue estimates of $12 million will end up being way too low if the company continues on this same run rate however given the number of new sales reps it’s likely this monthly sample processing number continues to increase as well.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vn94e2bovl61.png?width\u003d1456\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d69c92b0ea72c29614496c85b6d85fa168d4cefbc\n\n \n\n**TRIALS and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:**\n\nWhenever you are investing in the healthcare industry it’s important to take note of intellectual property, namely patents, that will protect the company going forward. Due to the company’s strong IP portfolio and solid pipeline I do wonder if they could be an acquisition target someday. These types of transactions are impossible to predict however with so many large pharmaceutical and biotech companies sitting on piles of cash it’s always a remote possibility.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnom547covl61.png?width\u003d1456\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003d8350ea28ff71e217145df9a71add383c9d3dc768\n\n \n\n**SHAREHOLDERS:**\n\nI like when the shareholder base has a nice mix of retail, institutional and insider ownership. I’m glad that 12.3% of $DMTK outstanding shares are owned by insiders including the founder — this gives them some skin in the game (no pun intended).\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/870erj9govl61.png?width\u003d1061\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003df4f3aceb3d06cdd158e0a9fd89e303c3b0fc909d\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7w8b9mqgovl61.png?width\u003d1056\u0026amp;format\u003dpng\u0026amp;auto\u003dwebp\u0026amp;s\u003deaabe32b1e502bbbf0775fb707cc12b6d8a7a04d","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464593,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vI1B57GgFWfa6zKBfwmPH492Y9q0QGUvsLptH-R35BI.jpg","thumbnail_height":41,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"$DMTK TO THE MOON BECUASE FUCK CANCER.

Here is my [DD on Chinese EVs PUTs play Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/). The drop wasn\u0027t really due to any of the shit I said before (yet), everything was bleeding, but when life throws money at you, you shake dat a$$.\n\nTook profits throughout last week, can see the [Xpeng gains](https://imgur.com/x6SSu50) here and [Nio gains here](https://imgur.com/SCpGZsM). Could\u0027ve been more, but I ain’t fuckin Miss Celo.\n\n\\*\\*Why\u0027d you sell pussy?\\*\\*I\u0027m just playing the dip. I had to get into some other positions, and will load up again at the top when we dead cat bounce, everything explained below. This ain\u0027t financial advice, I just don\u0027t like these stocks.\n\nLet’s check in on Q1 2021 projected PS ratios as of Friday’s close. These are going to real interesting once we get to Q1 earnings.\n\nTSLA: 15.7\n\nNIO: 17\n\nXPEV: 15.3\n\nLi: 10\n\nThere were some short term catalysts in the mix that also sprayed fuel to the fire last few weeks.\n\n\\- Nio missing EPS, hemorrhaging money\n\n\\- XPeng stock lock up period ended\n\n\\- Lackluster feb delivery numbers from both\n\nWell, how do you keep the growth story fueled? You need to grow Rev. How do you grow Rev? You need to grow deliveries. For all the reasons described in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/), I don’t see them breaking out in the sea of competition. For some reason, people think Nio and Xpeng are the only 2 EV companies in China. I did a casual forecast on deliveries for Feb. [Look at it and tell me where Nio and Xpev sits](https://imgur.com/8G5dlPt). This is not even all the smaller, upcoming players who didn\u0027t make top 20...\n\nYes, there is a Chinese new year effect in Feb on deliveries. All the millennials head to their hometowns from big cities, gloat to their parents about how much money they made, get questioned on when they’re going to get married. Little do they know, they’ve just been in a claustrophobic 1b apartment, stroking it to Fan BingBing on the daily. Ok, I digress, in reality, Nio and Xpeng have tiny pepe order books, and if you’re actually a hot growing EV brand, CNY shouldn’t affect you that much. Just look for Feb 2020 in the most updated deliveries chart. (Tesla Feb 2021 numbers will be out next week, I’m betting on this).\n\nNio’s EPS miss was no surprise if you look at their cost centers. They posted a growing, healthy vehicle margin, but tucked away a sickening amount of costs, just like your secret cum bucket.\n\n\\- All their early adopters, till last month, were still getting FR33 LIFE TIME battery swaps. So much for those service Revenue dreams\n\n\\- All those pretentious ass NIO houses? Prime real estate locations, yeah you bet rent is expensive AF. This doesn’t even scale, if NIO drops vehicle prices (which they need to if they want to grow) \u003d more NIO customers \u003d crowding NIO Houses \u003d less desirable. Forget crazy, even Sane Rich Asians don’t like to share with plebs, even without covid.\n\nXpeng doesn’t have it any better. There are 13,000 vehicles being recalled. I mean, that’s pretty much their entire Q of deliveries, Q1 earnings is going to be a bloodbath. Oh, shares lockup also ended on 2/23/2021, what would you do when your company is a get rich quick copy of Tesla? You dump those shares faster than Bogdanoff can make a call on his BB.\n\n**Outlook for 2021**\n\nIs Nio and Xpeng going to 0? Not right now, they’ve got more tricks and the YT pumpers haven’t gone through the 5 stages of grief yet. We\u0027ll likely see a dead cat bounce. Will wait until all these Nio \"investors\" are back in their circle jerking habitat, then pull the trigger and load up PUTs again.\n\nLet’s dispel some of these dilutions being force fed to you. It\u0027s time wake your ass up from that confirmation biased wet dream.\n\n1. Competition is fuckin fierce in China. Nio themselves have already cut their guidance, but based on chips shortage. I’d bet it’s more than just the Pringles, since CN Government tax credit got cut starting 2021.\n2. “CCP is backing Nio!” Yes, Nio has gotten some support from Hefei, a TIER 2 city in China. A single Tier 2 city does not equal the CCP. All these small city govs are trying to claw up the power ladder, so they can play in the big Tier 1 city leagues. As soon as Nio shows signs of weakness, they’ll drop’em without a second thought. Just like when your wife finds out were 100% maxed margins on NIO from last week.\n3. “But global expansion!” Here we go again. Besides what I already said in Part 1 about western demand for “Made in China” cars, think about it. Nio and Xpeng are playing in the biggest EV market in the world, instead of focusing attention on their home turf, where they’re still far from winning, they’re trying to expand overseas? That’s like getting into foreplay with Kendall Jenner, but you’re licking your lips and looking at Bruce in the other room!\n\nNio and Xpeng could just float around for awhile before the makeup comes off, but it\u0027ll become more apparent every quarter. There is always the off chance we get a you know who Coffee scenario, but they have 3 years to comply with audits.\n\n**What am I bag holding next?**  \n[Positions](https://imgur.com/oYPeCk3) :-  \n A few left over Nio \u0026amp; Xpeng lottery tickets for fun  \n\\- TSLA 3/19 $580 Cs  \n\\- Rest all in on Tesla and Rocket Lab commons\n\nNio and Xpeng are in the back view mirror for now, will load up PUTs again after the bounce. But the EV revolution is still happening. Who do you bet on?\n\nMy TSLA position got beat up like Elon in grade school. But just like papa in 2018, I’m doubling down and holding shares like a boomer. With the nice volatility we’re going to see in this upcoming kangaroo market, I’m taking advantage of the sky high IVs and selling CCs after short term catalysts.\n\n1. CN Feb deliveries for Tesla, that’s coming next week. This will be the first peak at Model Y numbers. You bet there is going to be movement, I sure am. See my naked calls above.\n2. For those of you that are looking at Tesla and think it’s still got a long way down to go, think again. Tesla\u0027s bottom line is about to get juicier when Q1 numbers roll around. For all the crying about Tesla making most of its profits from credits, it’s only about to get even more lucrative. Credits are not going away, take a look at the schedules (ZEV for example), it\u0027s only ramping up towards 2025. Simple supply and demand, more credits needed, legacy auto EVs deliveries absent, Tesla has them for sale.\n3. FSD is about to make the news cycle again. Elon said subs are coming Q2. But hey, you don’t have to believe the boy who cried wolf, because Auntie Cathie will save the day with ARK’s new report on Autonomy and PT on Tesla. It’s nice when you have the hottest (popular…) fund manager pumping your stock.\n\nAt the end of the day, this correction could go on longer, but there is no existential crisis here. Tesla is going to keep selling cars like Samoa flavored girl scout cookies. Those Credits and Sub Revenues will flow straight to the bottom line on earnings.\n\nNext up, Rocket lab. I won’t go into it, [you can read my post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwffta/rocket_labs_dd_found_the_company_that_actually/). This is going to be the beginnings of the next EV-like rally. When you can’t buy $paceX, Rocket Labs is your BFF. You can bet it\u0027ll be in ARKX.\n\nAs always, JJ\n\nTL;DR Christmas came early, sold my Nio and Xpev Puts for profits, kept a few lottery tickets for fun. Will load up on Puts once we dead cat bounce. A few TSLA 3/19 $580 Cs.

I mean legal.. Fuck it!\n\nThis is how you can risk all of your wendy\u0027s paycheck 100% risk free.\n\nNow this is what I do so copying what I do while certainly an option 💦 is not recommended.\n\nThe first step in how I take say $1,400 and put it into extremely risky positions with 1000% potential while also guaranteeing $1,400 remains in my account by the EoW is by firstly following sound advice. When it comes to options the ITM longer term dated Gen X strategies are great and like has been said 1000x 💦 around here already, is very similar to holding a long position in the underlying stock.\n\nOnce you do this after proper money printing or institutional greed the price of the stock will steadily rise. That is the magic of infinite credit and that is worth its own post. You however do not have that advantage and so the day that your ITM (ATM) LEAPs return 100% EoY (I know said EoW), as well as 7-8% market return average you can close out your position. In this way you have satisfied every standard of a boomer and can move your initial paycheck into index ETFs for extremely tiny volatility compared to what you just experienced for a year.\n\nNow step two: after returning 100% you can now put $1,400 risk free into extremely dangerous high reward positions without a shred of emotion. 0 dte purchased before close. The moon is the limit.\n\nStep THREE: every time this new portion of your YOYO portfolio returns over 100% move the investment into your sleepy, drooling index funds. If you repeat this strategy you will have zero fear in the market. Half of the people here are in this situation and cannot relate to your desperate Wendy\u0027s back-alley situation.\n\nMy portfolio looks like an amusement park. This is not financial advise.\n\nTLDR: purchase safe investments such as ATM index LEAPs and close your position out when you achieve 100% (ROI) + 7-8% (market RoR). Buy index ETFs with the initial investment + the 7-8% RoR and then spend the matched gains on extremely risky FDs and experience no emotions. Maybe get tendies.\n\nTLDR: Risk your life savings and you\u0027re the only one to blame.

I am posting this to present a long term bullish case for Palantir, and why I think this recent sell-off is a great buying opportunity.\n\nFirst, I am disputing the reliability of Cramer\u0027s picks. According to a 2016 study, the S\u0026amp;P 500 outperformed Cramer by 6% over a 15 year period. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13) .  I further contend that most positive performance is due to boomers mindlessly following his advice and thereby contributing to buying pressure, rather than high quality fundamental or technical analysis.\n\nSecond, Palantir Technologies\u0027 Gotham Software is widely used throughout government sectors, and it\u0027s Foundry Software is becoming largely incorporated for commercial purposes. Palantir has experienced 40% YoY revenue growth, with analyst forecasts of a 68% revenue increase in 2021, and unlike many high-flying tech companies, has not relied on large amounts of debt to sustain itself. This limits the downside risk, and even has Morningstar assigning it an undervalued rating. We are not known as value investors on this thread, but when companies that should be trading at 3x their so called \"fair value\" are trading below it, it\u0027s a good sign for full degenerates.\n\nThird, Palantir\u0027s RSI is drifting closer to oversold territory, with a 25% increase in shares short since January 29th. The MACD is currently drifting away from the signal line, but we should see bounce back/resistance at around the $20-21 mark, as we did last Friday. This will present a good opportunity for the bulls, as Alex \"The Magic\" Karp kicks the bears back up the stream.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464984,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"BULL!

Put on your seatbelt and get ready for the best TACO sauce DD ever!!! \n\nWhy was Del Taco’s earning report awesome? Because they bought back a bunch of their shares last quarter! Not to mention they have been serving boatloads of Tacos to smooth-brained monkeys like me and increasing their Tendies to 2019 levels with fewer stores opened! \n\nWe all know with the $1.9 trillion relief package on the horizon the demand for Fast Food will be increasing! Why?... because more stimulus money plus all this talk about marijuana legalization plus getting ready for GME rockets to the moon makes smooth-brained monkeys want to load up on fast food with 8 meals a day! \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the TACO sauce highlights:\n\n1. Earning report had an EPS smashing analysts’ estimates by 6 cents on a per-share basis! TACO Sauce factory is loaded!\n\n2. Only 5.9 million shares of TACO sauce available for General Public purchase. The company repurchased 496,356 shares last quarter! Low available shares \u003d Volatility if demand for TACO increases!\n\n3. Fintel shows Insider ownership of 56.22% with no one selling in the past two years! C-Suite has the biggest Dimond Hands ever!!!\n\n4. 10% short interest stuck prior to earning report!\n\n5. Franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5%! The company is looking to pivot with more franchisees as they bring in the Tendies!\n\n6. New “Fresh Flex” Store design recently announced to new franchise owners. Double drive-through lanes, delivery pick-up stations, and dedicated parking lot areas for those who want to park, eat tacos, smoke weed, and go!\n\n7. Del Taco is expanding into Columbus Ohio! Market exposure into Columbus \u003d more TACO sauce price increase! \n\n8. Del Taco\u0027s Twitter page shows the Crispy Jumbo Shrimp TACO is back. This is probably not relevant but who cares!\n\n9. The TACO sauce is currently undervalued as the Analyst show a strong buy with a price target of $12.5 on average and $15 high. Currently, there is a low resistance barrier at $11.71 and if it is passed tomorrow, then the sky is the limit!\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice. I don’t smoke weed, I love Tacos, I love the Stock, and I believe TACO sauce is extremely undervalued and needed to fuel my future GME moon voyage!\n\nPosition 75c 12.5 Mar 19th (I plan to double down tomorrow and get out before the GME rocket takes off!)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9464839,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Best TACO sauce DD ever!

So if I\u0027m reading that right, by the time of filing this report, Shitadel had bought 80 Billion $$$ of Tesla... 👀\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to [yahoo](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/institutional-holdings) the top institutional holder of Tesla is Vanguard at about 50M shares. Lol, Shitadel owns twice as much Tesla as the next biggest holder, and it\u0027s not even listed! Elon has a little less than half at about 227M according to [sec.report](https://sec.report).

You need to be prepared.\n\n🚨 Fair warning 🚨 \nBe prepared to lose everything you put in. \n\nUnlike the intelligible stock choices made by our battlefield legends like DFV, there is no data to support this or any DPO. Hype means more than numbers, no one knows how high or how low the stock can go, and only the grit and strength of the calluses on the itchy trigger fingers of our little degenerate meme stonk trading hands will determine when the stock takes a dive.\n\nOne thing is for sure, if you’re sitting at your desk at 0930 on 3tac10 what you put in will pop 🍾 whether or not you can read the room as to when to sell will determine if that fat stack of debt you can’t afford to lose becomes the gold for your new RuneScape membership or a deeper less forgiving hole of regret that will keep you up at night.\n\nAs for the me. I like the stock.\n\nI know it’s a terrible idea. So, I’m in!\n\nI have nothing to lose. She wants it. I know she’s dirty. I let that pre rope fly so she thinks she’s just another girl. Nothing special. I can last all night. And when I don’t return her text the next day. That’s when I’ve got her. That’s when I sell.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9465210,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Pre-Rope for RBLX.

This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism\n\n1. Backed by the CCP\n\n“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))\n\nThe CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China\u0027s biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Reasons for recent price movements\n\nThere are two causes for the recent price movements, and neither of them are particularly valid. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:\n\n* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3\n* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3\n* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3\n* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3\n\nWhile the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.\n\nThe second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Market Cap compared to competitors\n\n$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Potential for future growth\n\nAlthough $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.\n\n$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n5. The actual products\n\nIn order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for one hour before being able to drive 44 miles(source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\\~:text\u003dHow%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text\u003dHow%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.\n\n**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.\n\n11@39.29\n\n**TL;DR for TL;DR**: 📈📈📈📈💰💰🚀🚀🚀","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9465339,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"Why $NIO is a good buy","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0t3vy/why_nio_is_a_good_buy/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"author":"soapboxcity","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_2iq159sx","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1615245858,"domain":"self.wallstreetbets","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0t3gp/pltrrkt_gme_all_in/","gildings":{},"id":"m0t3gp","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#0392cf","link_flair_css_class":"yolo","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"YOLO"}],"link_flair_template_id":"da18a43a-83c5-11e8-9b6c-0e287561ddb8","link_flair_text":"YOLO","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"some_ads","permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0t3gp/pltrrkt_gme_all_in/","pinned":false,"post_time":1615245887,"pwls":7,"retrieved_on":1615245868,"score":1,"selftext":"I am adding 11 k to my spots.aint stoppin even while my girl is throwing my shit out in the front yard.

Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he\u0027d just left the company. I didn\u0027t know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd\u0027s only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I\u0027d make sure we had that.\nOn any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn\u0027t listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information wanted to stay out of prison.

Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he\u0027d just left the company. I didn\u0027t know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd\u0027s only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at a distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I\u0027d make sure we had that.\n\nOn any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn\u0027t listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information and wanted to stay out of prison. They said I probably knew what was going on but had no emails or recordings to back that up. They all walked and I got hammered with a 30 month prison sentence. So that\u0027s how you go to prison for insider trading without actually trading. It\u0027s all true! Just Google James Fleishman. As proof that I am who I say I am here is the AMA I did here a while back. https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1v42sp/table_iama_i_went_to_prison_for_a_crime_i_did_not/","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","subreddit_subscribers":9465650,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","title":"How to go to prison for Insider Trading without Trading","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0tqk2/how_to_go_to_prison_for_insider_trading_without/","whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"author":"WouldntRecommendl","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_93ikf31i","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1615247759,"domain":"self.wallstreetbets","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0tq4q/my_100k_promise/","gildings":{},"id":"m0tq4q","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#014980","link_flair_css_class":"meme","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Meme"}],"link_flair_template_id":"0513bea8-4f64-11e9-886d-0e2b4fe7300c","link_flair_text":"Meme","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"some_ads","permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0tq4q/my_100k_promise/","pinned":false,"post_time":1615248344,"pwls":7,"retrieved_on":1615247769,"score":1,"selftext":"If GME hits 100k I\u0027ll quit my job in the next 3 months, so i don\u0027t screw my team and can make future arrangements, and in my notice I\u0027ll just put the lyrics of pinnocchio\u0027s I got no strings.
